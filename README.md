- [Body Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)
- [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) assets management (Webpack v4)
  - [HMR](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) ready
  - [Extract text plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin)
  - [Code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)
- [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) + [Sequelize Typescript](https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript)
- Ready to use under [Docker](https://www.docker.com) environment
  - Very small image size (~95 MB)
- Unit test (using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) + [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest))
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) (Vue v2)
- [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com) (with [Material Design theme](http://daemonite.github.io/material/))
